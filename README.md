# Journey Maps in UX/UI Design

## Overview
Journey maps are visual representations that capture a user's experience with a product or service over time. They illustrate the user's interactions, emotions, and pain points across various touchpoints, providing insights into their needs and behaviors. By mapping out these experiences, designers can better understand the user's journey and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Purpose of Journey Maps
The purpose of journey maps is to gain a deeper understanding of the user's perspective and to empathize with their experiences. Journey maps help identify gaps in the user experience, reveal moments of frustration or delight, and guide the design process to create more user-centered products. They are crucial tools in aligning teams around the user's needs and ensuring that the design solutions address real problems.

## When to Use Journey Maps
Journey maps are typically used during the Define stage of the design process. After conducting user research and gathering insights, journey maps help designers define the key problems that need to be solved. They are also valuable in the Ideate and Prototype stages, as they provide a reference for generating ideas and testing solutions that align with the user's journey.

## Example Journey Maps
Below are two journey maps that correspond with the Transit App Personas from the [User Persona repository](https://github.com/WatchKataThrive/User-Personas). These examples demonstrate how a user's experience can be mapped out from awareness to retention, highlighting key touchpoints, emotions, and opportunities for improving the overall user experience.
